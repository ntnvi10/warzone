Bandit Level 1 → Level 2

As the file is named -(hyphen) we won’t be able to read it simply by cat command. 
As cat command considers -(hyphen) as stdin/Stout. 
If we directly use cat command, it won’t be able to understand that hyphen is a file name. 
So, we will prefix the command with the path ./

cat ./-   or cat <-

----------------------------------
Bandit Level 4 → Level 5

only one of them has human readable text.

for FILE in ./-file0*; do cat $FILE \n; done
for FILE in ./-file0*; do file $FILE; done
file ./*

-----------------------------------
Bandit Level 5 → Level 6

human-readable
1033 bytes in size
not executable

find -type f -size 1033c ! -executable   #b-block, c-bytes, k-KB, M/G-MB/GB
find . -size 1033c
find -type f -size 1033c ! -executable -exec cat {} \;
{} will substitute the particular file you found into the command (cat {} in this case); the \; is to end the -exec command.)
This will run cat once for every single file rather than running a single instance of cat passing it multiple filenames which can be inefficient

find [whatever] -exec cat {} +
This will pass multiple filenames to each invocation of cat, which can be more efficient.

find [whatever] | xargs cat
find [whatever] -print0 | xargs -0 cat

find -type f -size 1033c ! -executable -print0 | xargs -0 cat

command2 `command1`
This will send the output of command1 into command2 as command line arguments. 
Ex: cat `find . -name '*.foo' -print`
